**Maker's First Comment**:

Hey, Hunters! ðŸ‘‹

I'm the creator of the ActivityEngine, and I'm so excited to share it with you.

As a builder, I've always been frustrated by how we approach user engagement. We often jump to solutions like "add a leaderboard" without a systematic plan. I wanted a tool that forced a more rigorous, professional process from start to finish.

That's why I built the ActivityEngine. The "magic" is in the meta-prompts that guide the Gemini AI. We don't just ask it to 'gamify an app'. We force it to act as a team of specific expertsâ€”a project manager, a gamification designer, a risk analystâ€”to guide your thinking through a comprehensive, 14-step pipeline.

The "Pipeline" feature automates this, running your project concept through a whole team of these AI specialists, giving you a complete, professional-grade plan in minutes.

I'm on a #buildinpublic journey and would love your feedback. How can this tool better fit into your design and product management workflow?

Let me know what you think!
