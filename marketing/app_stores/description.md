**Subtitle**: Systematically Reshape Your User Experience

**Description**:

Go beyond surface-level gamification. The Activity Theory Design Engine is a professional AI tool that uses a powerful social science framework to help you solve the deepest engagement problems in your product, course, or workflow.

Stop patching symptoms like low retention. Start diagnosing the root cause. The Engine guides you to model your project as a complete "Activity System," identifying the core contradictions that block user motivation. Then, it helps you design targeted, tool-mediated interventions that create meaningful and sustainable engagement.

**HOW IT WORKS:**

1.  **DEFINE YOUR SYSTEM:** Describe your project. The AI will guide you to map out the Subject, Object, Tools, Community, Rules, and Division of Labor that constitute your activity.
2.  **DIAGNOSE CONTRADICTIONS:** The AI analyzes the system to pinpoint the internal tensions and conflicts that are the true source of user friction and disengagement.
3.  **DESIGN & SIMULATE:** The AI helps you design targeted "mediating tools" (new features, rules, or narratives) to resolve these contradictions and simulates how the system will evolve into a healthier, more engaging state.

**FEATURES:**

- **Systemic Analysis Pipeline:** Go from a vague problem to a structured, theory-backed solution.
- **Expert-Tuned AI:** Our meta-prompts transform the AI into a team of specialized Activity Theory consultants, analysts, and designers.
- **Deep Contradiction Analysis:** Leverage a proven framework to find and solve the problems that other methods miss.
- **For Any Project:** Applicable to UX/UI design, instructional design, organizational development, community management, and more.
- **Download & Go:** Export all generated analysis and design documents as markdown files or a single ZIP archive.
- **Private & Secure:** Your inputs are processed by the Gemini API and streamed directly back to you. We do not store your project data.
