2/ It uses a powerful social science framework to model your product as a complete "system."

The AI then acts as a consultant to diagnose the core "contradictions" that are blocking user motivation.

Is your UI (Tool) fighting your user's Goal (Object)? Let's find out.

3/ Here's how it works:
➡️ Describe your product or workflow.
⚙️ The AI guides you through a systemic analysis.
📄 You get a structured plan to resolve the core issues, not just patch them.

It's a professional design consultant in your browser.

4/ We didn't want an AI that just gives you generic answers. Our meta-prompts force the AI to act as a specialist—an Activity Theory analyst—to guide your thinking with deep, insightful questions.

5/ For product managers, it's a new lens for understanding your users. For designers, it's a framework for building truly engaging experiences.

We're building this in public and would love for you to try it out and give us your feedback! #buildinpublic #AItools
