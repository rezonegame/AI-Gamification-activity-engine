**Title**: Show HN: I built an AI tool to analyze any UX with Activity Theory

**Body**:

Many products suffer from low engagement, and the usual "gamification" solutions (badges, points) often feel like a fresh coat of paint on a broken engine. I wanted to go deeper.

To solve this, I built the Activity Theory Design Engine.

It's an automated pipeline that takes a description of any product, app, or workflow and uses a series of meta-prompts with the Gemini API to guide you through an analysis based on Activity Theory (CHAT).

Instead of just adding game elements, it helps you model your product as a complete system (of Subjects, Objects, Tools, Rules, Community, etc.) and then identifies the core "contradictions" within that system that are the real source of user friction. For example, when a community's "rules" conflict with the user's "objective."

The goal is to bring a more rigorous, systemic approach to UX and engagement design, moving beyond surface-level fixes to solve foundational problems. It's built with React and the prompts are the core "expert system."

I'd love to get your thoughts and feedback on this approach.
