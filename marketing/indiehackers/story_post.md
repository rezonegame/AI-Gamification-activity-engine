**Title**: From Chasing Engagement to Systemic Design: My #buildinpublic Journey with the Activity Theory Engine

Hey IH,

I've built enough products to know the painful gap between a "useful" product and an "engaging" one. We ship features, but users don't stick around. I realized I was treating symptoms, not the disease.

The "Aha!" moment came when I stopped thinking about "gamification" and started reading about "Activity Theory"—a social science framework for understanding *why* people do things in a system. It's about the deep-seated "contradictions" in a workflow, not just the lack of points or badges.

What if I could use an LLM, not to spit out gamification ideas, but to act as a professional Activity Theory consultant?

So I started building the **Activity Theory Design Engine**.

The core of the work wasn't the code (a standard React frontend). It was crafting the meta-prompts. Each prompt forces the Gemini AI to adopt an expert persona—a systems analyst, a consultant—and guide the user through a structured, professional analysis of their own product.

The pipeline is simple:
1.  You describe your product/workflow.
2.  The AI helps you model it as an "Activity System."
3.  The AI diagnoses the core "contradictions" (e.g., "Your rules conflict with your users' goals").
4.  The AI helps you design "tools" (features, new rules) to resolve those contradictions.

It turns a fuzzy feeling of "low engagement" into a concrete, actionable, systemic problem to solve.

My goal is to get 50 product managers, UX designers, and indie hackers to try it and give me brutally honest feedback. Is solving engagement at this deep, systemic level a problem that resonates with other builders here?

Check it out and let me know what you think!

Cheers,

[Your Name]
