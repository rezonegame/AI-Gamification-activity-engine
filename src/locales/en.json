    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "subtitle": "Have questions? We have answers.",
    "q1": { "question": "How is this tool's gamification design different from others?", "answer": "Our key differentiators are 'systemic' and 'research-driven'. We don't just suggest 'add a badge'. Instead, we first deeply understand your users and system goals through Activity Theory and player type analysis. Then, in a dedicated 'Ideation' phase, we explore multiple gamification concepts. Finally, we craft the most suitable concept into a complete system with a core loop, player journey, and a long-term optimization plan. It's a complete, professional process from 'why' to 'what' to 'how'." },
    "q2": { "question": "Is this tool for me? I'm not a professional project manager.", "answer": "Absolutely. The value of this tool is that it 'translates' professional planning processes and theories into a guided, practical set of steps that anyone can use. You don't need prior knowledge of Activity Theory or project management. Just provide your initial idea, and the AI will act as a professional planning consultant, guiding you through all stages like goal setting, budgeting, risk control, and material prep, generating professional documents along the way." },
    "q3": { "question": "Is my data private and secure?", "answer": "Yes. We do not store your documents or the generated outputs on our servers. Your input is sent directly to the Google Gemini API for processing and streamed back to your browser. Your input text is saved in your browser's local storage for convenience so you don't lose your work between sessions, but you can clear it at any time." },
    "q4": { "question": "Can I use the generated content commercially?", "answer": "Absolutely. The generated content is yours to use as a planning document, budget report, or risk control manual for your commercial projects. As with any AI-generated content, we always recommend you review, edit, and adapt it to perfectly fit your project's unique needs and legal requirements." }

      "title": "Our Product Philosophy: Designing Infinite Games",
      "p1": "In his book 'Finite and Infinite Games', James P. Carse describes two types of games: finite games are played for the purpose of winning, while infinite games are played for the purpose of continuing the play. Traditional product design often falls into a 'finite game' mindset—chasing short-term wins like feature launches or KPI targets. However, the products that truly retain users often exhibit qualities of an 'infinite game': they create a world where users can continuously grow, explore, and interact.",
      "p2": "The core philosophy of this tool is to help creators escape the 'finite game' trap. By using Activity Theory, we identify and resolve the systemic contradictions that end the 'play', enabling the design of 'infinite games'—experiences built on sustainable engagement, meaningful growth, and deep social connection."
